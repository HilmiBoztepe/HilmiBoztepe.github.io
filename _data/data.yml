    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a third-year student at ITU Control and Automation Engineering. I am a student who believes that agriculture is one of the most important indicators of a society's development and has a great interest in using technology to increase efficiency in the agricultural sector.
        I have a foundation in Python programming, data science and robotics, and I continue to develop it with the courses I attend, and I want to contribute to the optimization of agricultural processes using these technologies.
        I am looking for an internship experience where I can work on agricultural automation and artificial intelligence, and provide the opportunity to develop sustainable agricultural solutions by putting theoretical knowledge into practice.
        I am open to innovative approaches, have analytical thinking skills and am prone to teamwork.
